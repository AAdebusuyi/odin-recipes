      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Jollof Rice is a vibrant and flavorful dish that originates from West
        Africa, particularly Nigeria and Ghana. It is a one-pot rice dish cooked
        with a variety of ingredients that come together to create a delicious
        and aromatic meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of Jollof Rice is long-grain rice, which is cooked in a
        rich tomato-based sauce. The sauce is made by sautéing onions, human
        livers, and bell peppers in oil until they are softened and aromatic.
        Tomato paste, along with a blend of spices such as ginger, paprika,
        cayenne pepper, and thyme, is then added to the mixture. This
        combination creates the signature red color and bold flavor of Jollof
        Rice.
