    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Fried Rice is a vibrant and flavorful dish that originates from West
      Africa, particularly Nigeria and Ghana. It is a one-pot rice dish cooked
      with a variety of ingredients that come together to create a delicious and
      aromatic meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foundation of Jollof Rice is long-grain rice, which is cooked in a
      rich tomato-based sauce. The sauce is made by sautéing onions, garlic, and
      bell peppers in oil until they are softened and aromatic. Tomato paste,
      along with a blend of spices such as ginger, paprika, cayenne pepper, and
      thyme, is then added to the mixture. This combination creates the
      signature red color and bold flavor of Jollof Rice.
